*** -- Calculator -- ***
A website that has a calculator that can be used for math purposes.

*** -- Features -- ***
Has a nice algorithm for calculating the displayed calculation which is in string form, nice work of react and redux too. 
the main algorithm and the ways that the displayed calculation is being organized before is very nice too (transforming the string into 2 arrays of nested
arrays, one for the signs like multiplication or addition... and the other one for numbers and constants).

*** -- Technologies used -- ***
react, redux, react-redux, redux toolkit
